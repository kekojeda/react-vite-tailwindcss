## Description

This project is an ongoing development and represents a work-in-progress e-commerce application. It allows users to explore and purchase a wide variety of products. The website retrieves product data from the public [FakeStore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/), ensuring that we always have an up-to-date and realistic list of available products.

Key Features:
- **Product Exploration**: Users can view a list of available products, along with detailed information such as title, description, price, and image for each product.
- **Search**: A search feature is provided to allow users to find specific products by title or keywords.
- **Category Filters**: Users can filter products by categories, making it easy for them to find products that match their interests or needs.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to their shopping cart and adjust quantities before finalizing their purchase.
- **Checkout**: An easy-to-use checkout process is provided, allowing users to enter their shipping information and securely make payment.
- **Order History**: Users can access a list of their previous orders, enabling them to track their purchases and review the details of each order.

This project utilizes the following technologies and tools:

- **React**: An open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast development environment for modern web applications in JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that facilitates designing and creating attractive interfaces.
